One of these such distinctions differentiates the people who accomplish work for school for the sole purpose of completion, and the other type accomplish work for school and take pride in it. Being part of the latter, I've taken advantage of the video projects that teachers commission us to make to express my creative side—the one that looks at the world from a different viewpoint and, through the use of video, finds a new way to express it. \n\nBelow you will find some of the videos I made for school grouped by year, some in collaboration with other students.\n\n\n## 8<sup>th</sup> grade\n\n#### Stop Motion Taiwan\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8VZjRvbEE1M\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nEvery year, the 8<sup>th</sup> graders at the Lyçée Français de Shanghai (LFS) are tasked with the production of a stop motion movie for art class, which is then displayed and judged (by teachers) at a grade assembly. Since we also went on a class trip to Taiwan (to study seismology), our art teacher decided to kill two birds with one stone—have us film the stop motion in Taiwan which we would then edit in class. Of course what our teacher definitely did not plan was the possibility of us students not finding the time to take pictures of ourselves \"moving.\" In the end, my friend Pierre-Julien and I produced this video featuring some of the landscapes we saw in Taiwan, but also in other places in China we went on vacation such as Yunnan and Tibet. We found it had a relaxing and interesting mood. However, however, the judges thought that our video didn't have loud enough music and probably didn't enjoy our video as much as we thought they would. Ironically, the movie that won \"best picture\" was by the group of students that didn't have to film their stop motion in Taiwan. At least ours got \"best landscapes!\" \n\n#### Shanghai: Old and New\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hBdMwiJH-NE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n8<sup>th</sup> grade students at LFS are supposed to select an *accompagnement personnel* (AP), a personal accompaniment, where students get to choose an elective, offered by the school, that met twice per week. One of the APs I chose was art, for which we were asked to make a video of a field trip around Shanghai. With three other students—Lou, Amber, and Pierre-Julien, we made a video that featured intriguing landscapes, even though we were only in 8<sup>th</sup> grade and did not know that much about trying to avoid shaky and excessively long shots.\n\n## 9<sup>th</sup> grade\n\n#### My Favorite Poem Project\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2d3x3STp6NE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAs part of our Poetry unit in English, we discovered the [Favorite Poem Project](http://www.favoritepoem.org/), where people are asked about their favorite poem and recite it to the camera. Of course, at the end of the unit, we were asked to make a video of our favorite poem, following the style of the original ones. Although I didn't really take this project seriously—my hair was messy, the frames were very repetitive and I borrowed some footage from previous projects—I nonetheless had fun editing it. Probably the worst video I've ever produced, but then again it turned out to be surprisingly good. \n\n#### A Taste of Berlin and Trip to Austria\n\n<iframe width=\"50%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TLs95EHjUVQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"50%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HgvlEsYdCk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe International School of Boston (ISB) hosted an exchange with the Bundesgymnasium Dornbirn in Austria, where students from Germany and the United States got to experience a completely country. I was asked to produce two videos of the ISB students' trip to Europe, so I immediately got to work and captured footage with an old OnePlus 2. Although the image quality was not so good and the shots were shaky, the video turned out rather well, especially because of the accompanying music (Breezeblocks by Alt-J and Kids by MGMT) that enhanced the beautiful Germanic landscapes portrayed.\n\n## 11<sup>th</sup> grade\n\n#### Song of Myself – Verse 8\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://youtube.com/embed/vUaCTu31NJ8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nOne of our projects in American Literature consisted in choosing a verse from Walt Whitman's famous poem \"Song of Myself\". Verse 8 particularly stood out to me, as it features an intriguing depiction of the common people, an omniscient yet humble observation of the world around Whitman. Since the verse depicts so many different people doing so many different things, why not ask students and teachers at school to read lines from the poem? Equipped an old camera and tripod I had found lying around at home, I set off to capture footage of people around school. With the right music (I really liked the soundtrack from *L'incroyable destin d'Amélie Poulain*) I crafted a short video with the footage to produce an interesting video.","author":{"username":"Julian"},"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","width":200,"height":200,"src":"/static/b94e58dd0736f276853f2f8936389f03/eb72e/b7efbbc700475e453312370ce5dd102b.png","srcSet":"/static/b94e58dd0736f276853f2f8936389f03/eb72e/b7efbbc700475e453312370ce5dd102b.png 1x,\n/static/b94e58dd0736f276853f2f8936389f03/1e9e2/b7efbbc700475e453312370ce5dd102b.png 1.5x,\n/static/b94e58dd0736f276853f2f8936389f03/cf5aa/b7efbbc700475e453312370ce5dd102b.png 2x"}}}}},{"node":{"id":"Article_2","title":"MIT Museum Studio & Compton Gallery","content":"In the summer of 2019 I helped out at the [MIT Museum Studio and Compton Gallery](https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/mit-community/mit-museum-studio-and-compton-gallery) as an intern, a studio for students of the Art in Vision and Neuroscience and Paranormal Machines class at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I helped out with small tasks such as soldering and laser cutting to create demo lights, remade the entrance animation, tore down an exhibition to prepare for a new one, and designed signage while the exhibit was under repair.\n\nAmong the tasks that I accomplished during my time at the gallery, my two favorites ones were probably creating the demo lights and working on the entrance animation.\n\n## Demo Lights\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming school year, I was asked to make a complete version of a makeshift demolight that had already previously been produced, which used LED RGBW chips, a LUXDrive FlexBlock, and a few slide potentiometers:\n\n![Parts List](/uploads/7cdcfa0d8e4d48d1b0f74c8ceeff970b.png)\n\nAfter having communicated with the studio managers to get an idea of the design they wanted, which was to be 3D-printed, I set off to put together a protype for the lights, beginning with the planning phase:\n\n![The first sketch](/uploads/db2e33e285e84a79917a3e34e038515f.jpg) ![The second sketch](/uploads/9367f6ae7b59420eae5b294cd294df49.jpg)\n\nAnd then to create a 3D Model of the product:\n\n![text](/uploads/ae557915e708434bbac65ef24a65b2fa.png)\n\nUnfortunately 3D printing turned out to be too expensive, so what we came up with instead was to use layered laser-cut pieces of acrylic locked in place with large threaded wires. After a few more hours of planning and measuring, I was able to figure out a way for the parts to fit, using a modular plate system:\n\n![text](/uploads/44ceb630f2f54de3908c03035379014b.png)\n\nOnce assembled, the flashlights worked and to my suprise all of the parts fit perfectly into the laser-cut frame, which gave the product a professional look!\n\n![text](/uploads/c8b5e4a90ede4fe3af24765a42f0a5e1.jpg)\n\n## Entrance Animation\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://youtube.com/embed/DhSofC8HDak\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAt the entrance of the studio there is a monitor that displays an animation to show passersby that they were looking into *the MIT Museum Studio*. Since the monitor was being reconfigured, I was aked to remake the animation for the studio, based on a previous one that played with a text layer in between two sheets of dots, creating an interesting effect. I experimented with scale, rotation and more to create interesting effects for the animation.","author":{"username":"Julian"},"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":200,"height":200,"src":"/static/94d16fb43aa6b57637a74bfe6b6a00a2/9067c/70641261f1295a380773d343077d9724.jpg","srcSet":"/static/94d16fb43aa6b57637a74bfe6b6a00a2/9067c/70641261f1295a380773d343077d9724.jpg 1x,\n/static/94d16fb43aa6b57637a74bfe6b6a00a2/792e8/70641261f1295a380773d343077d9724.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/94d16fb43aa6b57637a74bfe6b6a00a2/b9fa4/70641261f1295a380773d343077d9724.jpg 2x"}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}}
