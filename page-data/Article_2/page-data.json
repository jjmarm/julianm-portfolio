I helped out with small tasks such as soldering and laser cutting to create demo lights, remade the entrance animation, tore down an exhibition to prepare for a new one, and designed signage while the exhibit was under repair.\n\nAmong the tasks that I accomplished during my time at the gallery, my two favorites ones were probably creating the demo lights and working on the entrance animation.\n\n## Demo Lights\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming school year, I was asked to make a complete version of a makeshift demolight that had already previously been produced, which used LED RGBW chips, a LUXDrive FlexBlock, and a few slide potentiometers:\n\n![Parts List](/uploads/7cdcfa0d8e4d48d1b0f74c8ceeff970b.png)\n\nAfter having communicated with the studio managers to get an idea of the design they wanted, which was to be 3D-printed, I set off to put together a protype for the lights, beginning with the planning phase:\n\n![The first sketch](/uploads/db2e33e285e84a79917a3e34e038515f.jpg) ![The second sketch](/uploads/9367f6ae7b59420eae5b294cd294df49.jpg)\n\nAnd then to create a 3D Model of the product:\n\n![text](/uploads/ae557915e708434bbac65ef24a65b2fa.png)\n\nUnfortunately 3D printing turned out to be too expensive, so what we came up with instead was to use layered laser-cut pieces of acrylic locked in place with large threaded wires. After a few more hours of planning and measuring, I was able to figure out a way for the parts to fit, using a modular plate system:\n\n![text](/uploads/44ceb630f2f54de3908c03035379014b.png)\n\nOnce assembled, the flashlights worked and to my suprise all of the parts fit perfectly into the laser-cut frame, which gave the product a professional look!\n\n![text](/uploads/c8b5e4a90ede4fe3af24765a42f0a5e1.jpg)\n\n## Entrance Animation\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://youtube.com/embed/DhSofC8HDak\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAt the entrance of the studio there is a monitor that displays an animation to show passersby that they were looking into *the MIT Museum Studio*. Since the monitor was being reconfigured, I was aked to remake the animation for the studio, based on a previous one that played with a text layer in between two sheets of dots, creating an interesting effect. I experimented with scale, rotation and more to create interesting effects for the animation.","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/94d16fb43aa6b57637a74bfe6b6a00a2/0a89a/70641261f1295a380773d343077d9724.jpg","srcSet":"/static/94d16fb43aa6b57637a74bfe6b6a00a2/1b150/70641261f1295a380773d343077d9724.jpg 240w,\n/static/94d16fb43aa6b57637a74bfe6b6a00a2/6ece9/70641261f1295a380773d343077d9724.jpg 480w,\n/static/94d16fb43aa6b57637a74bfe6b6a00a2/0a89a/70641261f1295a380773d343077d9724.jpg 960w,\n/static/94d16fb43aa6b57637a74bfe6b6a00a2/c87a3/70641261f1295a380773d343077d9724.jpg 1440w,\n/static/94d16fb43aa6b57637a74bfe6b6a00a2/14dee/70641261f1295a380773d343077d9724.jpg 1920w,\n/static/94d16fb43aa6b57637a74bfe6b6a00a2/a8d59/70641261f1295a380773d343077d9724.jpg 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"}}},"author":{"id":1,"username":"Julian"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Article_2"}}}
